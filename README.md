**Bug Smasher Game**

Bug Smasher is a simple, interactive game where players aim to "smash" a moving bug on the screen by clicking on it. The game starts with a bug image randomly positioned on a canvas. Upon clicking the bug, the player earns a point, and the game accelerates as the bug moves to a new random location. The game includes a score tracking system displayed on the screen.

### Features:
- **Graphics**: The background is set with an image of leaves, and the bug is depicted with a bug image, both loaded dynamically onto the canvas【7†source】【8†source】【9†source】.
- **Gameplay**: 
  - A new bug appears randomly on the canvas at intervals. Players must click on it to increase their score and speed up the game【9†source】.
  - If the bug is successfully clicked, the game's speed gradually increases, challenging the player to keep up【9†source】.
  - A reset button is provided to restart the score and the game speed, giving the player a fresh start anytime【9†source】.
  
- **Controls**: Players can use the "Reset Score" and "Reset Speed" buttons to modify the game at will【8†source】.

### Technologies Used:

- **CSS**: Styles the game elements, providing a clean, centered design with visually appealing buttons and text【7†source】.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, including bug movement, scoring, and dynamic difficulty adjustments【9†source】.
